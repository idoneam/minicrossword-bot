# minicrossword-bot
A Discord bot that keeps track of user-submitted scores for the NYT minicrossword in a db file.

Supports users adding their times, displaying most recent times, deleting times, displaying user averages, and displaying rankings for the more difficult Saturday crosswords and the regular ones. 

## Usage:
Make sure `git` is installed and configured correctly on the machine you're running it on, then run: `git clone https://github.com/idoneam/minicrossword-bot/`. Install the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, and run the bot by executing `Main.py`. If the git instance is configured correctly and the clone worked, then you can install updates by issuing the command `%update` in the server you're using the bot in.
